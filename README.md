# DROID-GOGGLEPACK
This pack provides language-extensions for the eurorack module [droid](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/der-mann-mit-der-maschine-droid) in [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The core features are:
- Syntax highlighting for all relevant parts of the droid programming language
- Dark & light themes based on Monokai
- Code snippets for all circuits (including input & output parameters)
- Code snippets that provide a standardized way to describe your patch (and generate print layouts with the webapp)
- Integrated HTML-file-builder that allows you to:
  - print your patch configuration and description (hardware-layout / inputs / outputs / variablenamings)
  - map input & output registers to variables very easily so you don't have to think about register-numberings anymore
  - provide quick access for other users to understand (and reuse) your patches or only snippets
