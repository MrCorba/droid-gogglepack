# DROID-PACK
This pack provides language-extensions for [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The core features are:
- Syntax highlighting
- Dark & light themes based on Monokai
- Snippets for all circuits that include all possible input&output parameters
- Snippets that provide a standardized way to describe your patch
- Automatically build web-files for your patches to:
  - generate nice prints of the current hardware/input/output-configuration
  - easily generate input/output->variable mappings so you don't have to think about register-numberings all the time
  - provide an easy way for others to reuse your patches (or snippets)
